Each pixel has a specific color and intensity.\n","\n","Resolution: Refers to the number of pixels in the image, often represented as width x height (e.g., 1920x1080).\n","\n","Color Depth: The number of bits used to represent the color of a single pixel, influencing the range of colors that can be displayed.\n","\n","Representation in a Computer\n","Digital images are represented as a grid of pixels. Each pixel is assigned a value (or values) that determine its color and intensity:\n","\n","Grayscale Images: Each pixel is represented by a single value, indicating its brightness. Common grayscale depth is 8 bits, allowing for 256 different shades of gray.\n","\n","Color Images: Each pixel is represented by multiple values, typically three (for RGB color model: Red, Green, Blue). The combination of these values determines the pixel’s color.\n","\n","Differences Between Grayscale and Color Images\n","Grayscale Images: Contain only shades of gray, ranging from black to white. Simpler and use less storage as each pixel needs only one value.\n","\n","Color Images: Contain a full spectrum of colors by combining red, green, and blue values. More complex and use more storage, as each pixel requires three values."],"metadata":{"id":"C0ryrtEzSq1q"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#2.Define Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and discuss their role in image processing.Describe the key advantages of using CNNs over traditional neural networks for image-related tasks&"],"metadata":{"id":"iJ7IjXJlSqvd"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n","Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of artificial neural network designed for processing structured grid-like data,\n","such as images.

They are responsible for detecting various features in the input images, such as edges, textures, and shapes. The primary purpose of these layers is to apply convolution operations to the input, which helps in feature extraction and reduces the spatial dimensions of the image, making the network more efficient.\n","\n","Filters and Convolution Operation\n","Filters (or kernels) are small, learnable matrices used in convolution operations. During the convolution, these filters slide (or convolve) over the input image, performing element-wise multiplications and summing the results to produce a feature map. Each filter is designed to detect specific patterns or features in the image, such as horizontal or vertical edges.\n","\n","Padding and Strides\n","Padding: Refers to adding extra pixels (usually zeros) around the input image to preserve the spatial dimensions after the convolution operation. Padding helps in maintaining the size of the output feature map and ensures that edge features are not lost.\n","\n","Same Padding: Keeps the output size the same as the input size.\n","\n","Valid Padding: No padding, resulting in smaller output size.\n","\n","Strides: Refer to the number of pixels by which the filter moves over the input image. Adjusting the stride size affects the spatial dimensions of the output feature map.\n","\n","Stride of 1: Moves the filter one pixel at a time, producing a larger feature map.\n","\n","Stride greater than 1: Moves the filter more pixels at a time, reducing the size of the output feature map.\n","\n","Impact on Output Size:\n","\n","Padding: Increases the size of the output feature map.\n","\n","Strides: Larger strides decrease the size of the output feature map, while smaller strides keep it closer to the input size."],"metadata":{"id":"R-LS7qJOSqeU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#4.Describe the purpose of pooling layers in CNNs.Compare max pooling and average pooling operations."],"metadata":{"id":"GEhsvXoCSqat"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Purpose of Pooling Layers in CNNs\n","Pooling Layers are used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the input feature maps.
